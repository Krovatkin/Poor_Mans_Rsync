###Virology I: How Viruses Work

####S1

* **Zoonotic** passed from animals to humans

* People usually have at least **2** types of herpes and  ~ **12** at the same time.  

* **The Human Microbiome** enumerating microorganims in people 

* **Virome** no such project

*Genome contents:
	* **LTR** (Long terminal repeats) are viral seqs (8%) 
	* **Introns** are non-protein-coding seqs (26%) 
	* Protein-coding genes (1.5%)

	* Some viruses are useful
	* **Polyoma** viruses are used to trace human migration and settlement 
	* Panic grass can survive in very hot env (>50C) due to fungus+virus combo

* Avian virus was modified to enable it to be airborne. Exps on ferrets.

####S2

Virus is an *infectious obligate (have to do it) intracellular parasite. 

Exists in **2** stages: 
* virion (virus particle, chemical) consists of proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydates)
* infected cell.
Think of a seed or spore

Viruses are small: from 20-800nm

Mimivirus, 800m, 1.2M base pairs, ~911 protein-coding genes.



Viruses reproduce using host's cell protein synthesis machinery.
Bacteria uses **binary fission**.


####S3

Ancient time references:
	* Rabid Hector
	* Polio 

Variolation uses original viral material from an infected individual
Vaccinaction uses less dangerous related viral material. For example, The cowpox virus is used to produce a smallpox vaccine

Edward Jenner did the first successful vaccination in 1790

The inventions and theories:
* Leewenhoek invented a microscope
* Pasteur ( meat/maggot experiment) disproved the theory that non-living things can produce living organisms 
* Koch (bacteriology) developed a method to test if a particular microorganism is the cause of a disease

In 1892, investigating **Tobacco Mosaic virus**, Ivanovsky shows:
	* infectious agents are very small (<0.2 micron)
	* need host cells to replicate 

Virus Discovery:

*1901 yellow fever
*1903 rabies 
*1906 variola 
*1908 poliovirus
*1911 rous sarcoma
*1915 bacteriophages
*1933 influenza virus

Virus Classification:
* nature and sequence of nucleic acid in virion 
* symmetry of a protein shell (capsid)
* presence or absence of lipid membrane 
* dimensions of virion & capsid 


mRNA ribosomes use cell's translation machinery
