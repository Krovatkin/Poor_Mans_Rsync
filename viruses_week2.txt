piconoviruses

polio viruses

The infectious cycle

attachment/entry (have RNA)
translation
genome replication (more RNAs)
Assembly (more virions)


Susceptible (functional receptor)
Permissive (capacity to replicate)
Resistant has no receptor

chicken egg (animal model)

Allantoic inoculation (used for vaccinces) influenza 


Enders, Weller, Robbins
propogate poliovirus in human cell culture of embryonic tissues 

cell lines:
Human epithelial (cont)

mouse fibroblast cell line (cont) 

primary human foreskin fibroblasts (primary)

diploid ()


Hela Cells 


Viral effects:

cytopathic effects (how do we know that virus replicate)

s2 
how many viruses in a sample
infecivity

physical particulers 

1930 plaque assay

1952 plaque assay for animal viruses

synctitium 

endpoint dilution assay

dont kill cells or dont from plaques

TCID50 dilution at which 50% of stock is infected

particle-to-pfu

Why not successful

--- Damaged Particles
--- Mutations
--- Complexity of infections

s3 :

hemagglutination 

viruses bind but do not infected
blood cells with viruses bind to other blood cells forming lettuce
short-term viruses detach
1941 GK Hirst 

HA - 512

measurement of viral enzyme activity
reverse transcriptase (copies RNA into DNA)
virus enzyme copies a subtrate into a radio-actively labelled product (radioactive triphosphate and magnesium)
which then can be detected by radiograph 

immunostaining
Direct

Viral Antigen <- virus specific Ab w/ an fluorescent indicator 

InDirect Virtal Antigen <- Ab (murine) <- moose Ab
 

immunoblotting

separated by electircal current
blotting tank
proteins transferred to nitrocellulose

add antibody

use autoradiograph 

ELISA

antibody 
viral antigen binds to an antibody
second antibody with an indicator to viral antigen


B) if antibodies present

viral antigen 
antibody in a sample sticks to antigen


S4 Revolutionary methods

FLuorescent proteins (discovered in jelly fish)

put a fluorescent protein into virus so it expresses its gene


herpes virus (neurotropic) 

Polymerase Chain Reaction

Thermo Stable DNA
