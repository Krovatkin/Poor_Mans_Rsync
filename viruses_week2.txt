### S1

Viruses can be grouped by an infectious cycle
Polio virus a member of Picornaviruses (similar infectious cycle)
The whole cycle occurs in cythoplasm

The Infectious Cycle

* Attachment/Entry (have RNA)
* Translation
* Genome Replication (more RNAs)
* Assembly (more virions)

* **Susceptible** -- Functional Receptor
* **Permissive** --  Capacity to Replicate
* **Resistant** -- No Receptor

chicken egg -- animal model
Allantoic inoculation used for making influenza vaccinces  

*Enders, Weller, Robbins* propagated poliovirus in human cell culture of embryonic tissues 

cell lines:
Human epithelial (continuous, grow indefinetely)
mouse fibroblast cell line (continuous) 
primary human foreskin fibroblasts (primary, die off after 20-30 divs)
diploid cell strains (100 divisions, human embryonic lung cells)


Hela Cells 


Viral Fffects:
* **Cytopathic Effects** -- how do we know that virus replicate 
	* syncytium -- a cell containing multiple nuclei. 
	
### S2 

Counting cytopathic effects (plaques)

	* 1930 plaque assay	
	* 1952 plaque assay for animal viruses

* 0.1 ml is diluted (1/10, 1/100, 1/1000, etc) until the number of plaques is in 2 digits.
* Measured in **PFU/ml** (e.g. 1.7 x 10^8)


* One-hit kinetics, the number of plaques is linearly proportional to virus concentration 
* Two-hit kinetics, the number of plaques is squarely proportional to virus concentration  

Endpoint dilution assay

* Rows of 10 monolayer cell cultures
* Each row is infected with different dilutions 
* **TCID50** -- the dilution (endpoint) shows 50% of stock is infected

Viruses can be unsuccessful due 

* Damaged Particles
* Mutations
* Complexity of infections (Infectious cycle)

### S3

**Hemagglutination**, 1941, GK Hirst 

* Viruses bind but do not infected
* Blood cells with viruses bind to other blood cells forming lettuce
* Short-term process: viruses detach

Measurement of viral enzyme activity
Uses **reverse transcriptase** (copies RNA into DNA)
* Virus enzyme copies a subtrate into a radio-actively labelled product (radioactive triphosphate and magnesium)
which then can be detected by radiograph 

**Immunostaining**
* Direct
	* Viral Antigen <- virus specific Ab w/ a fluorescent indicator 
* Indirect 
	* Viral Antigen <- Ab (murine) <- moose Ab
 

**Immunoblotting**
* Proteins separated by electircal current
* Placed in blotting tank to transfer the proteins to nitrocellulose
* Antibodies are added 
* Autoradiograph is used to detect antigens

ELISA

* Solid w/ an Ab <- Viral antigen <- Ab w/ an indicator 
* Solid w/ viral antigen and binded Ab <- 2nd Ab w/ an indicator 

### S4 

Fluorescent proteins (discovered in jelly fish)
Add a fluorescent protein to virus' genome so it expresses its gene

For example, the protein was added to herpes virus
which is a **neurotropic** (capable of infecting nervous cells)

Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), in 1983 by *Kary Mullis*

Needs 
* Sample to amplify
* Primer to bind and start building DNAs
* Thermostable Enzyme to amplify the initial sample 

Occurs in 3 stages:

* In **Denaturation** DNA strands are separated
* In **Annealing** Primer binding)
* In **Elongation** DNAs are built 

Deep, High-Throughput Sequencing allows fast and accurate sequencing 

### S5

**One-step growth cycle**
*Ellis & Delbruck*, 1939, studies on *E.coli*

* **Adsorb** let particles infect as many cells as possible
* **Dilute** or neutralize remaining unadsorbed particles
* **Sample** to measure
* **Assay**  				infectivity 

When all cells infected
* **Eclipse Period** -- no infectivity detected
* **Burst/Yield** -- number of infectious particles increases drastically

Few cells infected 
* Goes through multiple eclipse periods (multiple cycles)

**Adenovirus type 5**
Intracellular activity measures eclipse period
Extracellular activity measures latent period

**Synchronous infection** -- infect all cells
**MOI** (multiplicity of infection) - Number of infectious particles added per cell

Poisson distribution: P(k)  = e^(-m)m^k/k!

P(0)  = e^-m (fraction of cells infected with 0 particles)
P(1)  = me^-m
P(>1) = 1 - P(0) - P(1)
