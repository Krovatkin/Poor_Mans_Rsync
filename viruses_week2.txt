piconoviruses

polio viruses

The infectious cycle

attachment/entry (have RNA)
translation
genome replication (more RNAs)
Assembly (more virions)


Susceptible (functional receptor)
Permissive (capacity to replicate)
Resistant has no receptor

chicken egg (animal model)

Allantoic inoculation (used for vaccinces) influenza 


Enders, Weller, Robbins
propogate poliovirus in human cell culture of embryonic tissues 

cell lines:
Human epithelial (cont)

mouse fibroblast cell line (cont) 

primary human foreskin fibroblasts (primary)

diploid ()


Hela Cells 


Viral effects:

cytopathic effects (how do we know that virus replicate)

### S2 

how many viruses in a sample
infecivity

physical particulers 

1930 plaque assay

1952 plaque assay for animal viruses

synctitium 

endpoint dilution assay

dont kill cells or dont from plaques

TCID50 dilution at which 50% of stock is infected

particle-to-pfu

Why not successful

--- Damaged Particles
--- Mutations
--- Complexity of infections

### S3:

**Hemagglutination**, 1941, GK Hirst 

* Viruses bind but do not infected
* Blood cells with viruses bind to other blood cells forming lettuce
* Short-term process: viruses detach

Measurement of viral enzyme activity
Uses **reverse transcriptase** (copies RNA into DNA)
* Virus enzyme copies a subtrate into a radio-actively labelled product (radioactive triphosphate and magnesium)
which then can be detected by radiograph 

**Immunostaining**
* Direct
	* Viral Antigen <- virus specific Ab w/ a fluorescent indicator 
* Indirect 
	* Viral Antigen <- Ab (murine) <- moose Ab
 

**Immunoblotting**
* Proteins separated by electircal current
* Placed in blotting tank to transfer the proteins to nitrocellulose
* Antibodies are added 
* Autoradiograph is used to detect antigens

ELISA

* Solid w/ an Ab <- Viral antigen <- Ab w/ an indicator 
* Solid w/ viral antigen and binded Ab <- 2nd Ab w/ an indicator 

### S4 

Fluorescent proteins (discovered in jelly fish)
Add a fluorescent protein to virus' genome so it expresses its gene

For example, the protein was added to herpes virus
which is a **neurotropic** (capable of infecting nervous cells)

Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), in 1983 by *Kary Mullis*

Needs 
* Sample to amplify
* Primer to bind and start building DNAs
* Thermostable Enzyme to amplify the initial sample 

Occurs in 3 stages:

* In **Denaturation** DNA strands are separated
* In **Annealing** Primer binding)
* In **Elongation** DNAs are built 

Deep, High-Throughput Sequencing allows fast and accurate sequencing 

### S5

**One-step growth cycle**
*Ellis & Delbruck*, 1939, studies on *E.coli*

* **Adsorb** let particles infect as many cells as possible
* **Dilute** or neutralize remaining unadsorbed particles
* **Sample** to measure
* **Assay**  				infectivity 

When all cells infected
* **Eclipse Period** -- no infectivity detected
* **Burst/Yield** -- number of infectious particles increases drastically

Few cells infected 
* Goes through multiple eclipse periods (multiple cycles)

**Adenovirus type 5**
Intracellular activity measures eclipse period
Extracellular activity measures latent period

**Synchronous infection** -- infect all cells
**MOI** (multiplicity of infection) - Number of infectious particles added per cell

Poisson distribution: P(k)  = e^(-m)m^k/k!

P(0)  = e^-m (fraction of cells infected with 0 particles)
P(1)  = me^-m
P(>1) = 1 - P(0) - P(1)
